Attack Speed:
If a character's Strength is less than than the weight of the weapon they have equipped, then the attack speed is reduced by the amount by which the weight exceeds their Strength. Otherwise, attack speed is equal to the character's Speed.

If WWT = Strength, then AS = Speed
If WWT > Strength, then AS = Speed - (Weapon Weight - Strength)

Repeated Attacks:
AS of attacker is 4+ the AS of defender

Hit Rate:
 Hit Rate = Weapon Accuracy + Skill x 2 + Luck / 2
            + Support Bonus + S-Rank Bonus + Tactician Bonus

Evade:
 Evade = Attack Speed x 2 + Luck + Terrain Bonus
         + Support Bonus + Tactician Bonus

Accuracy:
Accuracy is used in battle to determine how likely a character is to hit another character, using the difference between the attacker's hit rate and the defender's evade. In-game information windows may refer to Accuracy as "Hit", e.g. FE7

FE1, FE2, FE3:
 Accuracy = Hit Rate (Attacker) - Evade (Defender)
  ~All: Capped to between 0 and 100

FE4, FE5, FE6, FE7, FE8, FE9:
 Accuracy = Hit Rate (Attacker) - Evade (Defender) + Triangle Bonus
  ~FE5:             Capped to between 1 and 99
  ~All other games: Capped to between 0 and 100

Attack Power:
The formula is similar to last time, except for a few additional complexities. Light 
Brand and the Wind Sword are treated as physical unless used at range when they are 
calculated using a special formula below; Runesword however is always calculated 
with the special formula. In addition, the Weapon effectiveness depends on the 
nationality of the game version used. The Japanese version sticking with the 
classical 3 or 1 (except for the dragon slaying weapons other than Aureola which use 2) 
and the western versions moving to a new 2 for effective and 1 otherwise. In addition 
the Weapon Triangle bonus works as before (+1 for strong, -1 for weak and 0 otherwise) 
except that when using Swordreaver, Swordslayer, Lancereaver and Axereaver it becomes +2 
or -2 for both weapons, unless both parties are wielding one of them in which case it 
reverts to the normal +1, -1. Also note that for weapon triangle purposes, Light Brand and Wind Sword used indirectly count as light and anima magic respectively, while Runeswordis always treated as dark magic.

Physical Attack = Strength + (Weapon Might + Weapon Triangle Bonus) X Weapon effectiveness + Support Bonus

Special Case (see above) = Strength / 2 + (Weapon Might + Weapon Triangle Bonus) X Weapon effectiveness + Support Bonus


Defense Power (defense):
Defense power is a measure of the total damage a character can negate from enemy attacks.
The formula used depends on the game; terrain bonuses and a character's Defense or Resistance are normally the most important factors.
Physical:
FE6, FE7, FE8, FE9, FE10:
 DP = Terrain Bonus + Defense
      + Support Bonus
       ~FE7's Light Brand and Runesword are counted as magical attacks regardless of the range being attacked from.
       ~FE9's Sonic Sword, Flame Lance, Bolt Axe and Runesword are also counted as magical attacks regardless of the range being attacked from.
Magic:
FE6, FE7, FE8, FE9, FE10, FE11:
 DP = Terrain Bonus + Resistance
      + Support Bonus


Actual Damage:
Damage is the amount of health an attack takes away from a defending unit if the attack hits. It depends on the attacker's attack power and the defender's Resistance or Defense (for magical or physical attacks respectively.).
Damage = Attack Power (attacker) - Defense Power (defender)

Critical Damage:
ActualDamage x 3 (simple)

Critical Rate:
 Critical Rate = Weapon Critical + Skill / 2
                 + Support Bonus + Class Critical + S-Rank Bonus

Critical Evade:
Critical Evade = Luck + Support Bonus + Tactician Bonus

Crit Chance (the actual number you should get...):
Critical = Critical Rate - Critical Evade
